# SQL Introduction
This directory contains SQL projects concerning
the concept of database utiliztion using mysql:

 Databases are used to store and persist data in applications.
 Storing data in memory or flat files has limitations, such as data loss when the server stops or lack of transactional guarantees.
 Databases provide ACID properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
 Relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) and NoSQL databases are the two main types of databases.
 NoSQL databases refer to various non-relational databases that serve different purposes and may or may not use SQL syntax.
 NoSQL databases gained popularity but have now stabilized, while relational databases remain the most widely used.
 Software engineers should have a strong understanding of relational databases due to their prevalence, but it is also important to be familiar with popular NoSQL databases.
 CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Destroy) are fundamental operations performed on data in databases.
 SQL syntax is often considered difficult to use by developers.
 Developers who are comfortable with SQL are highly respected in the industry.
 Non-relational databases, known as NoSQL, emerged as an alternative to SQL.
 ORMs (Object-Relational Mappers) abstract away SQL queries but may be less valuable in certain projects.
 SQL syntax can be challenging for beginners, and it is recommended to follow a tutorial.
 Relational databases have consistent SQL versions and terminology across different brands.
 Tables in relational databases store related data, and columns represent different information with specific types.
 Relations connect records across different tables, such as linking comments to posts using foreign keys.
 Indexes improve query performance by precomputing SELECT queries based on specific conditions.
 Joins allow tables with relations to be combined for efficient data manipulation.
 NoSQL databases, like document-based databases (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB), accept JSON documents without strict schemas.
 Key-value stores (e.g., Cassandra, memcached, Redis) are suitable for large-scale caching and offer advanced storage and retrieval features.
 Some NoSQL databases can be queried using SQL syntax, while relational databases are incorporating document-based storage.
 The choice of NoSQL storage depends on specific requirements and can vary significantly.
